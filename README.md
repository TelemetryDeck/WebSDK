# Telemetry Deck Web

This package allows you to send signals to [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) from your website or blog.

## Prerequisites

- You'll need access to your website's code to install this package. If you're using a CMS like WordPress, you'll need to be able to edit the theme files.
- You'll need a TelemetryDeck account. [Sign up for free](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com/registration/organization?source=websdk) if you don't have one yet.
- You'll need a TelemetryDeck App ID. [Create a new app](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com/apps/create) if you don't have one yet.

Note that if you are a programmer working on a node package based JavaScript application, we recommend you use the [TelemetryDeck JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/JavaScriptSDK) instead.

## Installation

Once you have your App ID, edit the source code of your website and add the following code snippet to the `<head>` section of every page, making sure to replace `<YOUR APP ID>` with your actual App ID:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.telemetrydeck.com/websdk/telemetrydeck.min.js"
  data-app-id="<YOUR APP ID>"
></script>
```

## ðŸ“± You need an App ID

Every application and website registered to TelemetryDeck has its own unique ID that we use to assign incoming signals to the correct app. To get started, create a new app in the TelemetryDeck UI and copy its ID.
